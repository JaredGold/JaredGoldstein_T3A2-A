# BoxBox

## What is BoxBox?
BoxBox is a service for people who want to purchase boxes but are unsure which type, size and color they want that box. The goal for the application is that it is a subscription service where users can receive a random box containing a set of box nets which the user can then build. It in a sense is two things in one, a useful tool to purchase boxes and a fun game of building said boxes.
